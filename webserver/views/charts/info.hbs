            Charts made by Michael Fatemi and Suhas Nandiraju
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Please note that the predictions <b>will not always be accurate, and will continue to change as more data is collected.</b><br/>
                    This tool is just to provide a general idea of the potential cases in the future.

                    Smoothing factor: looks N days before a certain day, and N days after that certain day, and finds the average. If it's at the end of the chart, it fills in with the closest value.

                    Prediction method 1: <i>logistic curve.</i><br/>
                    Logistic curves are similar to exponential growth, but take into account how much of the population is already infected.<br/>
                    Here's a good explanation: <a href="http://youtu.be/Kas0tIxDvrg">video</a><br/>
                    To fit to the curve, we used <code>scipy</code>'s function <code>scipy.optimize.curve_fit</code>. X = number of days since the first case, Y = number of cases. The function form is MAX/(1 + e^(-(x - inflection_x)/time_to_rise).<br/>

                    Prediction method 2: <i>1-Dimension Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN)</i><br/>
                    This is a method of machine learning that can features trends in segments. We chose a 1D CNN due to its relative speed compared to other models and its ability to derive features from a segment of data using matrix convolution. The input data is the past n days of cases and the output is the amount of cases on the next day. This method of prediction has been tested by chinese researchers who tested a similar model on wuhan confirmed cases data. <br/>
                    We used <code>pandas</code>, <code>numpy</code>, <code>scikit-learn</code>, and <code>Keras</code> for the 1d CNN.<br/>
                    To get to article about the 1D CNN on wuhan cases, look here: <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.23.20041608v1.full.pdf">article</a><br/>
                    Because it takes a somewhat long time to train, we cached the data.<br/>
